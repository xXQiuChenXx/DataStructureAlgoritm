If you use command prompt and MinGW to compile your program, here is the explanation of
the compile command.
1. Make sure the path in command prompt is the path where your C file is.
2. gcc lab1.c command will compile a saved C file named lab1.c and generate an
executable file for the source file.
3. By default, the executable file is named a.exe.
4. Adding -o lab1.exe ensure that the executable file is generated and named specifically
as lab1.exe.

```
gcc lab1.c -o lab1.exe && lab1.exe 
```
